            <li>5 mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, cut into matchsticks</li>
            <li>1 carrot, cut into matchsticks</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons light soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon doubanjiang (soybean paste)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 medium spring onion, finely sliced</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            
            <li>Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over high heat. Whisk eggs together in a Bowl. Pour into the skillet and stir-fry quickly until lightly set, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer to a large plate. Set aside.</li>

            <li>Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a wok over high heat. Add green beans, mushrooms, bell pepper, and carrot; stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer to a large plate; set aside.</li>

            <li>meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until they are just starting to soften, but are still pretty firm, about 4 minutes. Drain and rinse cooked noodles under cold running water. Drain and separate. Transfer to a Bowl and add just enough oil to coat the noodles so they won't clump together.</li>

            <li>whisk water, light soy sauce, soybean paste, oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, and sesame oil together in a Bowl until sauce is well combined.</li>

            <li>combine cooked noodles, vegetables, eggs, and sauce in the same wok and stir fry over medium-high heat until everything is warmed through and noodles and vegetables are cooked to your liking, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve immediately sprinkled with spring onions.</li>
